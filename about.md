I write Haskell and Bitcoin code at [Bitnomial](http://bitnomial.com).
Previously, I worked in financial technology consulting, and I co-founded
PeerTrader, a peer-to-peer lending automating investment platform. I studied
Physics and Mathematics at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign where I
worked on simulations and data analysis for statistical models of complex
phenomena.

My general interests include:

- Haskell
- Bitcoin
- Cryptography
- Security
- Physics
- Mathematics
- Philosophy
- Types
- Compilers
- Functional Reactive Programming
- The web
- Graphics
- Oculus and virtual reality
- Climbing
- [Emacs](https://github.com/WraithM/emacs.d) / [vim](https://github.com/WraithM/dotfiles/blob/master/.vimrc)
- Human languages (Icelandic, German, and Japanese)
