### History

Chicago Haskell was started in 2009 by
[Jeremy Shaw](mailto:jeremy@chicagohaskell.com). Other members like
[Luke Hoersten](mailto:luke@chicagohaskell.com) joined later that year
and the group grew from there. The group existed primarily on the
[mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/chicago-haskell)
and [IRC](irc://freenode.net/#ChicagoHaskell) to begin with and moved
into
[Google+](https://plus.google.com/communities/116633609119253853717)
and [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Chicago-Haskell/) as the platforms
gained popularity.

### Organization

Currently the group is loosely organized by:

- [Jeremy Shaw](mailto:jeremy@chicagohaskell.com)
- [Luke Hoersten](mailto:luke@chicagohaskell.com)
- [Matt Wraith](mailto:matt@chicagohaskell.com)
- [David Johnson](mailto:david@chicagohaskell.com)
- [Reid Draper](mailto:reid@chicagohaskell.com)

And whoever wants to help and get involved!
