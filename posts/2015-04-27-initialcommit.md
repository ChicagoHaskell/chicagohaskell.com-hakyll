In this inaugural post, I'll introduce myself and the possible topics that I'll
tackle in this blog.

I studied Physics and Mathematics at the University of Illinois in
Urbana-Champaign. I worked for Prof. Karin Dahmen in studying complex systems.
Specifically, we were interested in the statistics of avalanche-like phenomena.

I'm an avid Haskell programmer.
